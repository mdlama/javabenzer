    Displays a matrix showing the interactions between the items and
    allows the user to rearrange order of items to produce
    "arrowhead" patterns described in the Shkurba method of 
    problem solution.  To move an item (either vertically or
    horizontally), just drag it to the new location.

    <td width=10%><strong>Cliques</strong></td>
    <td width=80%>
    Displays a matrix showing the maximal cliques (rows) and
    the items (columns) which belong to them.
    Allows the user to rearrange order of cliques (groups of 
    interacting items) or the order 
    of the items.  This can be used in the traditional 
    solution method of recursively ordering the cliques.
