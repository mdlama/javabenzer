This program was originally designed to deal with deletion mapping 
of the genetic fine structure, but it works with many other types of
problems, too. Basically, it provides a way to visualize and manipulate
data sets where the data items form clusters. There are a few terms that 
you need to be familiar with in order to understand these help pages.

<p>
<ul>
	<li>
Item - An item is simply a data element which may (or may not) interact
with other data elements. In deletion mapping, these items are clone cell
lines. In food webs, they are species of organisms.
	</li>
<br/>
	<li>
Clique - A clique is a group of items which all interact with each other.
In a high school, they might be a group of students that hang out together.
In deletion mapping, they are a group of mutants where the missing DNA
fragments overlap (so they can't recombine to product a wild-type). In a 
food web, they are a bunch of organisms that all compete for the same food 
source (e.g. eagles and foxes both eat rabbits).
<br/>
<br/>
In graph theory terminology, the cliques we are concerned with are actually
"maximal cliques", which just means that they are as big as they can be --
there are no items not in this clique which interact with every item already
in this clique.  If we were to try and add another
item to a clique, it would turn out that it fails to interact with at
least one of the items currently in the clique (that's what makes this
clique "maximal"). Since all the cliques we are concerned with are "maximal",
we will just refer to them as cliques.
	</li>
<br/>
	<li>
Panel - A panel is simply a particular way of displaying (or changing the data).
This program has three major types of panels.
<ol>
	<li>
Shkurba (and its Edit sub-type) - which shows a matrix of iteractions between
items or which items belong to which cliques. In the Edit sub-type, you can 
change those interactions or the labels on the rows and columns of the matrix, 
as well as the descriptions in the "key box" for that panel.
</li>
<li>
Display - this is just a simple textual description of the items and which
other items they interact with, or the cliques and which items are members of 
them
</li>
<li>
Graph - these are diagrams showing which items interact with each other 
(intersection) or the negation of that, items which do <b>not</b> interact
with each other (complementary).
</li>
</ol>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
The program presents a menu along the top of the screen with a 
number of major tabs:

<dd> <a href="file.html">File</a> 
<dd> <a href="panel.html">Panel</a> 
<dd> <a href="order.html">Order</a> 
<dd> <a href="options.html">Options</a> 
<dd> <a href="help.html">Help</a> 
</dd>

<p>
The menu system is hierarchical, in that many selections provide a choice of
other selections (e.g. "File" allows you to "Open" a file, "Save" a file,
"Print" something or "Exit" the program). You need to click on a top level
selection (e.g. "File") to open its sub-menu, but simply mousing over a lower
level selection will show its options (if any).
