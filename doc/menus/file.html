<td width=10%><h2>New...</h2></td>
<td width=90%>
Allows user to create a new problem via one of two methods.
  <table width=100% border=0 cellspacing=12>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td width=10%><strong>Random</strong></td>
    <td width=90%>
	    This selection is really only useful for deletion mapping 
	    problems because its algorithms depend on a knowledge of
	    the biology underlying this type of problem. <br/><br/>
    The program will ask for the number of mutants you wish to 
    generate, and it will allow you to choose the number of 
    deletion regions to be identified.  FYI, experience 
    has shown that mutant/deletion region ratios of about 2:1 
    tend to produce interesting problems.
    <br/><br/>
    Currently, there are three different algorithms available for generating 
    problems (unimaginatively called "generate_0 method", "generate_1 method"
    and "generate_2 method"). You can select whichever you want of the three.
    All three generate legitimate problems, but there are qualitative
    differences in the likely layouts of the deletion regions. Personally,
    I recommend using "generate_2". It produces problems that resemble a
    cross between those produced by the other two methods.

    <td width=90%>
    The program will first ask for the number of items you wish
    to enter data for, then it will invoke a GUI interface (the
    same used by Panel --> Edit... --> Items) to 
    allow you to enter overlap data for the  problem. Essentially, 
    you click on a square of the interaction matrix to change its
    state.  Matching cells mirrored across the diagonal will be 
    changed automatically.  Hint: if corresponding cells <b>don't</b>
    match in a deletion mapping data set, the problem is inconsistent.
    </td>
    </tr>

  </table>
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td width=10%></td>
<td width=90%>
In either case, default names will be assigned to the items by the program.
The default names are of the form "Item #xx", where "xx" is a number from 1
to the number of items that you specified. The width of this field will be
adjusted so it is wide enough to represent the largest item number. Leading
zeroes will be added for smaller numbers.

<p>
You can change these names by clicking on a row or column label and entering 
name you want (e.g. if you want "Item #01" to be "Timber Wolf", instead).
You can change the labels in the "Key Box" (in the upper right of the panel)
in the same way.

<p>
If you decide to change them later, you can always select the correct Edit panel
and do the same things.

<p>
Note: Edit -> Cliques will let you change the labels and the key text, but not 
which items belong to a particular clique. 
</td>

</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td><h2>Open...</h2></td>
<td>
Opens an existing file containing a saved problem. Note that all files 
used to store problems are in a csv (commqa separated value) format which is
familiar to Excel and a number of other spreadsheet programs. You can use one
of those to view or edit the data and the result (saved as a csv) should still
be usable by javaBenzer.

<p>
These files don't need to have a "csv" extension, but it's not a bad practice,
just to remind you what format it's in, and it helps Excel know how to open them.

<p>
The default location for these files is in a folder named "data" which is in the 
same directory as the javaBenzer.jar file.
</td>

<tr valign="top">
<td><h2>Import</h2></td>
<td>
Imports a problem from a csv file created with an older version of javaBenzer 
(5.x or before). The major difference is that instead of a list of items that 
each item interacts with, it has a matrix of one's and zero's indicating 
if each item interacts (or not) with every other item. The "Export" option
(further down this page) will save a problem in this format.
</tr>

<tr>
<th colspan=2><hr></th>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td><h2>Save</h2></td>
<td>
Saves the problem currently being processed using the file's current name. 
<br/>
The first time you try and save a problem after either randomly generating it 
or entering it manually, this option will be grayed out because there is no
current filename to use. Instead, use "Save As...".
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td><h2>Save As...</h2></td>
<td>
Saves the problem currently being processed
with a name you provide using a file chooser dialog box. 
Note that filenames should end with the "csv" extension 
because the format of the save file is consistent with 
the "Comma Separated Value" format used by Microsoft Excel.
This means that Excel can read and write javaBenzer-compatible 
files.

<p>
The default location for these files is in a folder named "data" which is in the 
same directory as the javaBenzer.jar file.

<p>
If there is already a file with that name, you will be asked for confirmation
before it is overwritten.
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">

Exports the problem currently being processed in the older javaBenzer format 
(verion 5.x or before). This is th reciprocal function of "Import" described above.
