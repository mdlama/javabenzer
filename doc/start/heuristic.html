<h1>A Heuristic Solution</h1>

<p>
However, let us reconsider the original problem (Table I) in a different way. In 1965, Shkurba 
developed a matrix manipulation to a canonical form -which allowed an analysis of Gershenzon's 
"hypothesis that supplementary nutrition of Drosophila larvae with preparations of DNA caused 
mutations which affect whole sections of the chromosome." We can easily see that this biological 
problem is exactly equivalent to the "Benzer" problem. Therefore, let us consider Shkurba's solution 
because we contend that by considering the 3 kinds (ad hoc, algorithmic, and heuristic) of solutions 
to topological mapping of genes, we will offer students multiple ways of understanding problem 
solving. The first step in Shkurba's solution is to convert the matrix as displayed in Table I to the 
fully symmetrical form and to use blocked out cells in the matrix rather than zeroes and ones because 
it is easier to visualize when one has reached an appropriate canonical form of the matrix which he 
refers to as possessing the "basic property".

<p>
At this point, we will alter from our previous process by presenting Shkurba's answer first and then 
returning to an analysis of the process whereby he arrived at his conclusion. We will use the same 
example as before. First, table I is easily completed to make a fully symmetrical matrix as seen in 
Figure 11.

<p>
Second, try to gather all the black squares about the diagonal in order (1) to minimize the moment 
of the matrix and (2) to make sure that no squares are unattached to other squares by less than a 
full side. Furthermore, Shkurba says that (3) all arrowheads should be pointing toward the same 
corner of the matrix. These three conditions, if they can be satisfied, represent the conditions for 
constructing an interval graph of the deletion mutants. Thus, if we rearrange rows and columns in 
Figure 11, we see that the conditions are approached if we interchange the order of 5 and 6 
mutants (Figure 12).

</tr>
</table>

interchanged in the sequence of their rows and columns.

<p>
Only one additional third step is required in this case to draw all the black squares together and 
satisfy the conditions for the "basic property"; this is simply achieved by inserting mutant 1 between 
mutants 4 and 6 in Figure 12 (see Figure 13).

<p>
We can easily see that the diagonal can be represented as four overlapping blocks (Figure 14).

Figure 16.

<p>
Now it is a trivial problem to assign a mutant to an interval corresponding to the block (and only 
that block or blocks) to which it belongs (see Figure 15).

Figure 15.  The interval graph determined by the Shkurba (1965) method on the
same data employed throughout this paper.  Each block in Figure 14 is given 
one interval on a line and the mutants are represented by lines extending
over each interval (block) of which they are a member.

<p>
Figure 15 is isomorphic with Figure 10. The overlapping blocks in Figures 13 and 14 correspond 
exactly to "maximal cliques." Shkurba is able to present an algorithm employing the theory of partially 
ordered sets; however, we want to use his "basic form" to illustrate the power of heuristics. While 
heuristics are thought to be weaker methods than algorithms, for simple problems such as occur in 
undergraduate textbooks, our students usually preferred the Shkurba method over the other two 
because by a little trial and error they could quickly convert a data matrix into the "basic form." 
Students have quite powerful pattern recognition experience and they find it easy to check their 
progress towards a "basic form" solution to such problems. However, if the matrix is extremely 
large, most students prefer to use the graph theoretic algorithm.
