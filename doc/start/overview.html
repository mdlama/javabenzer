<H1>Introducing javaBenzer</H1>

This describes the concepts behind javaBenzer and shows examples
which provide a basic "how to" for using the javaBenzer program to
solve certain types of problems involving relationships between
interacting data elements.  

<p>
It is named for Dr. Seymour Benzer who carried out fine-structure 
genetic mapping in 1955 using this type of analysis.  In his 
experiments, the data elements were mutants with sections of their 
DNA deleted, and the interaction was whether two particular mutants 
could, via crossing-over, produce fully functional offspring.  This 
analysis allowed Dr. Benzer to produce a map showing the areas of 
deletion occurring in each of the mutant strains.

<p>
It's name also indicates that it is written in the Java computer 
language and ought to be easily transportable from one hardware/software 
configuration to another.

<p>
These same techniques can be used in ecology (and other fields) to
examine things such as the competition between different groups of
organisms and their resource requirements.
