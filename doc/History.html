<H1>History</H1>
<p>
The history of javaBenzer goes back to the spring of 1980 when I (VS) 
took an undergraduate genetics course from John Jungck. While preparing
for the final exam, I decided to write a computerized tool to produce sample
problems that I could practice solving. Although the Apple II was on the
market by then, they were still less than common, and the IBM PC did not
yet exist.  We did have access to a Tektronix Graphics Terminal which could
be programmed in BASIC, so I produced a program about a hundred lines long
to generate randmon problems (poorly).

<p>
A few years later, John worked with Peder Junck and Stephen Everse to
transfer it to run on an Apple II. In addition, they added a graphical 
interface to allow you to re-arrange columns of data and display the
updated problem.

<p>
I was surprised when I saw their work a few years later and began considering
the possibility of porting it to other operating system and extending it.
With John's support, I decided to re-write it in the c computer language
and port it to the IBM PC running Microsoft operating systems. The biggest
internal change was a significantly improved problem generation alogorithm
which solved most of original's difficultes in producing consistent,
solvable problems.

<p>
Supporting the program on multiple hardware/operating system platforms 
was highly desired, but quite difficult. In the mid-1990's, the language,
Java, appeared. Since Java used a virtual environment customized for each
hardware/operating system combination and application software ran within
this environment, the goal of supporting the program across multiple 
platforms seemed to be attainable. So I (VS) performed another re-write 
of the program to move it from c to Java, producing the first version
of javaBenzer.

<p>
javaBenzer had a number of advances allowing users to customize their
experience while keeping the maintenance of the code base relatively
simple.  I released occasional patches to fix bugs or add minor
functionality, but javaBenzer remainded relatively stable for the
following two decades.

<p>
However, computer languages are dynamic, they change as technology and
software "best practices" change. By 2020, javaBenzer was starting to
show its age. Some functions stopped working because Java had changed 
and it would take more than trivial patches to restore that functionality.
Growing bored during the COVIDi-19 Pandemic, I decided to put some
significant work into javaBenzer in March 2021. After about a month,
I realized that I was extremely dissatified with the internal structure
of the code base and decided to re-write javaBenzer from the ground up.
This was a significant undertaking because it had grown to about 6500 
lines of code and it took me about four months to reach the point of a
new, public release, javaBenzer 7.

<p>
javaBenzer 7 is a little smaller than the previous version (about 6000 
lines of code) and encompasses the previous functionally, broken bits
(e.g. printing) have been repaired and some new fuctions added. Since
the help system framework I was using is now dead, I produced a simple 
set of web pages that are accessed using the computer's default web
browser. I've also added a simple "undo" function, which was often 
requested. If you accidentally drag a row or column to the wrong place,
typing control-z will undo that move (with a few restrictions). It will
produce text listings of both items and cliques, as well as draw graphs
showing item connectivity (i.e interactions). There are lots of minor
improvements, most of which are described in the "menu" pages.

<p>
Enjoy!
