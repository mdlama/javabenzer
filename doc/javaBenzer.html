<H1>javaBenzer Online Help</H1>
<p>
The javaBenzer program is intended to solve certain types of problems 
involving relationships between interacting data elements.  In other 
words, it allows you to see and work with data clusters.

<p>
It is named for Dr. Seymour Benzer who carried out fine-structure 
genetic mapping in 1955 using this type of analysis.  Its name also
contains a reference to the fact that is written in the Java computer
language and ought to be easily run on many different hardware and 
software platforms.

<p>
These same techniques can be used in ecology to examine the 
competition between different groups of organisms based on their 
resource requirements.

<p>
