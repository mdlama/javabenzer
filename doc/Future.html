<p>
There are a number of extensions that didn't make it into javaBenzer 7, but may be added in the future.

<ul>
	<li>
		The spectre that overshadows everything else is automated problem solution.
		I (VS) developed the necessary algorithm back in the 1990's. However...
		<ul>
			<li>
				Having that available in a teaching tool does serious damage
				to its pedagogical value. If I can come up with a good solution
				to this issue, I'd love to make it available for use in a
				research setting, but don't expect to find it in javaBenzer
				any time soom.
			</li>
			<li>
				Another thorny problem is what to do in the case of less than
				perfect data. With consistent data, producing a solution is
				trivial. However, if even a single interaction data point is
				"wrong", the algorithm may chase its own tail forever trying
				to produce a "perfect" solution.
			</li>
			<li>
				Even if the data is perfect, solutions are not typically unique.
				Even beyond flipping the entire solution end-for-end, there 
				can be smaller sections that could be ordered in different 
				ways. How do I make it obvious that this is one of a number of
				possible solutions? For teaching this doesn't matter much, but
				it could be crucial in research.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Selecting (and moving) a group of rows (or columns) at the same time. There
		are a number of considerations for this item.
		<ol>
			<li>
				For students, the problems are typically small enough that this
				doesn't provide significant value. During testing, I've solved
				problems with hundreds of items and cliques, and I acutely felt
				the need for that functionality.
			</li>
			<li>
				The display becomes a little confusing since the program can't
				determine if the user is selecting rows or columns until they
				perform a move or Order operation.
			</li>
			<li>
				If I did allow group selection, I'd also extend the Order 
				operations (Sort/Reverse) to operate on selected groups, rather
				than the entire problem.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		It would be nice (for large problems) to enable autoscrolling, so when you
		dragged the mouse out of the displayed area, the view scrolled. Again, not 
		particularly valuable for small problems, but saves a lot of effort on large 
		problems.

	</li>
	<li>
		It would be nice to perform random problem generation for other types of
		problems than just deletion mapping (e.g. food webs). Unfortunately, most
		clustering problems have customized restrictions on what constitutes a
		valid problem, so each problem generator would need to be customized as well.
	</li>
</ul>
